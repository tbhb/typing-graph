## Inspirations

[Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev)'s approach to type introspection and metadata extraction inspired this library. typing-graph builds on Pydantic's [typing-inspection](https://typing-inspection.pydantic.dev/latest/) library for low-level type introspection.

## AI help

This project uses [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs) as a development tool for:

- Rubber ducking and exploring design alternatives
- Drafting documentation and docstrings
- Generating test scaffolding and boilerplate
- Code cleanup and refactoring suggestions
- Researching Python typing edge cases

All contributions undergo review and testing before inclusion, regardless of origin.
