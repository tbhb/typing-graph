        Thank you for reporting a bug! Your report helps improve typing-graph
        during its pre-release development.

        **Important**: typing-graph is pre-1.0 software in active development.
        Some behaviors may change as the library evolves.

        Please provide a **minimum reproducible example** (MRE) - a minimal,
        complete code sample that demonstrates the issue. This is crucial for
        quickly identifying and fixing the bug.
