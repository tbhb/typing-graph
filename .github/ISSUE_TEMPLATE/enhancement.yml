        Thank you for suggesting an enhancement to typing-graph!

        **Important context about this pre-release project:**
        - typing-graph is in active pre-1.0 development with rapidly evolving
          APIs
        - Breaking changes are acceptable and encouraged when they improve the
          design
        - The project is not yet accepting pull requests (see
          [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tbhb/typing-graph/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md))
        - Enhancement suggestions help shape the project's direction before the
          1.0 release

      label: Problem or limitation
      description: >-
        What problem are you trying to solve? What limitation are you
        experiencing? Describe the use case or scenario that motivated this
        enhancement request.
      placeholder: >-
        When inspecting complex generic types, I need to access the type
        parameters separately, but the current API doesn't provide an easy way
        to do this.

      label: Proposed solution
      description: >-
        How would you like to solve this problem? What API or feature would you
        like to see? Include code examples showing how you'd like to use the
        proposed feature.
      placeholder: |
        Add a `type_params` property to the node that returns the generic type
        parameters.

        ```python
        from typing import Annotated
        from typing_graph import inspect_type

        type MyList = Annotated[list[int], "metadata"]

        node = inspect_type(MyList)
        print(node.type_params)  # [int]
        ```

      description: >-
        What alternative solutions or workarounds have you considered?
        Why are they insufficient?
      placeholder: >-
        I could use typing.get_args() directly, but it doesn't handle the
        Annotated unwrapping that typing-graph provides.

        Note: Breaking changes are acceptable for pre-1.0 development if they
        improve the design.
      options:
        - "No breaking changes needed"
        - "Minor breaking changes acceptable"
        - "Major breaking changes acceptable"

        What kind of applications would benefit from this feature?
      placeholder: >-
        Building a validation library that needs to extract constraints from
        Annotated metadata while also understanding the underlying generic
        structure.
